# Java_Final_project

This is the final project for my CIS-171 Java course at kirkwood community college.
Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Introduction

I haven't done any java coding before so this will be a ***learing experiance***. I think it will be fun to learn this language. The one thing that I have heard is that in java you use __curly brackets__ which is a little hard. I have learned _htlm_ and _python_ so I think it will not be to hard to figure out, but with startng class learing the new way I have to learn to make _for_ or __while__ loops. 


## Chapter 1 

I have leaned a little more this week. We used ***Bigdecimals*** and learned how to make big numbers and small numbers. We learned how to __multiply__ and *divide* small and big numbers. We learned more of some of the __For Loops__ and some more of the *While Loops*. This week was good to learn how to *** Add, Subtract, multiply and Divide *** with big and small numbers. 


## Chapter 2

We learned about the __Math Class__, **Char Data type** , and __Boolean data types__. With the math class we looked at a lot of the common uses for the math class like ***Math.pow , Math.Max and min, Math.sqrt and Math.round.*** We learned the __char__ is a character in single quotes the is a single letter. And of course the **boolean** is the true or false values. We learned the logical operators like the *** and, or , and not ***. we learned casting which i think is cool you can make a __doulbe to an int__ if you just need the int for the output. 

## Chapter 3

We learned about __if statements__, **nested ifs**, ***Dates***, and __Switch statments__. __Dates__ was fun we were able to get days of the week, days, months, and years from any date that we put in so we could tell what day of the week someone was born and we did an exercise to see someones zodiac sign was. We did more with the __For Loops__ and then learned about the **while and Do While loops**. We did the __Break statement__ and the ***continue statement**. 

## Chapter 4 

We learned about creating __classes__, __methods__, and __objects__. We leanred how to make a class to do 1 thing like to make a class to calculate something to then take it and to call it for another thing you need. **Method** are fun because they can get called in anything that has a public return that can be accessed. THis will make coding better and less hassling since you can save things and reuse the code for other projects. 


## Chapter 5
