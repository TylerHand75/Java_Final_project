# Java_Final_project

This is the final project for my CIS-171 Java course at kirkwood community college.
Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Introduction

I haven't done any java coding before so this will be a ***learing experiance***. I think it will be fun to learn this language. The one thing that I have heard that in java you use __curly brackets__ which is a little hard. I have learned htlm and python so I think it will not be to hard to figure out, but with startng class learing the new way I have to learn to make _for_ or __while__ loops.
