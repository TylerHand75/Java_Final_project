# Java_Final_project

This is the final project for my CIS-171 Java course at kirkwood community college.
Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Introduction

I haven't done any java coding before so this will be a ***learing experiance***. I think it will be fun to learn this language. The one thing that I have heard is that in java you use __curly brackets__ which is a little hard.
I have learned _htlm_ and _python_ so I think it will not be to hard to figure out, but with startng class learing the new way I have to learn to make _for_ or __while__ loops. 


## Chapter 1 

I have leaned a little more this week. We used ***Bigdecimals*** and learned how to make big numbers and small numbers. We learned how to __multiply__ and *divide* small and big numbers. We learned more of some of the __For Loops__
and some more of the *While Loops*. This week was good to learn how to *** Add, Subtract, multiply and Divide *** with big and small numbers.
