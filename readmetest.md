&& 	Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non zero then condition becomes true. 	(A && B) is false.
|| 	Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non zero then condition becomes true. 	(A || B) is true.
! 	Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false. 	!(A && B) is true.

Short-Circuit Evaluation: Short-circuiting is a programming concept by which the compiler skips the execution or evaluation of some sub-expressions in a logical expression. The compiler stops evaluating the further sub-expressions as soon as the value of the expression is determined. Below is an example of the same:


Instance variables are declared at the same level as methods within a class definition.  They are usually given private access to restrict visibility.  They can receive initial values either when they are declared or in a constructor.  


public means you can access it anywhere while private means you can only access it inside its own class

he Java argument is a variable whose value is passed into a function and is used whenever a function is called. The parameter is the value that is defined in a functional block.



The method charAt(int index) returns the character at the specified index. Index should be between 0 and string length-1.


The method compareTo() is used for comparing two strings lexicographically. Each character of both the strings is converted into a Unicode value for comparison.



getMinValue(int[] numbers)

getMaxValue(int[] numbers)



int temp = x;
        x = y;
        y = temp;


creating object

Point originOne = new Point(23, 94);






Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance. Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks.




count++ is post increment where ++count is pre increment. 


A static method can call only other static methods; it cannot call a non-static method. A static method can be called directly from the class, without having to create an instance of the class. A static method can only access static variables; it cannot access instance variables.

number = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Result:");
        for (int i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }

 String str = " \"Akshit Loves GeeksforGeeks\" ";
